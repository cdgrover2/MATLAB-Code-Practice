%Version 1, simplistic, Fx,Fy,dx,and dy are known
function output = advec(dx,dy,Fx,Fy)
    if  ~exist('Fy','var') % That is F is a scalar and not a vector
        output = Fx/dx + Fx/dy;
    elseif exist('Fy','var')
        output1 = Fx/dx;
        output2 = Fy/dy;
        output = [output1,output2];
    end
end

%Version 3, directional derivative Gx(dF/dx) + Gy(dF/dy)
%Dimensions will need to be adjusted as needed for function to work
function output = advec(x,y,F,Gx,Gy)
    output1 = Gx.*(diff(F)./diff(x));
    output2 = Gy.*(diff(F)./diff(y));
    output = [output1,output2];
end
