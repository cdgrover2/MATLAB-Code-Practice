%Oversimplified Version for single values or anything that doesn't have several dimensions
function output = rel_vort(dx,dy,du,dv)
    dvdx = dv./dx;
    dudy = du./dy;
    output = dvdx - dudy;

%01/27/2024: MATLAB includes zeta function for Reimann zeta function. Renamed function to rel_vort to avoid confusion. Included oversimplifed version where dx,dy,du, and dv are known.
